#
**This is an app I created with my teammates at HackRU.**
#

###
To compile this code first clone the repository:
###

```
git clone https://github.com/Satya191/ruhappy.git
```

###
Then move into the new directory:
###

```
cd ruhappy
```


###
Then install dependencies by running:
###

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

###
Run the script:
###

```
python Camera_Flask_App.py
```

###
Thats it! Type ```127.0.0.1:5000``` into your url and you will see the application running.
